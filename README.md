# Order-Book
This order book system is designed to simulate and process financial orders in a dynamic and configurable manner. It incorporates essential trading mechanisms such as order generation, market sentiment adjustments, and real-time processing of buy and sell orders. Hereâ€™s an overview of its functionality:

Order Types:

Limit Orders: Users specify a price at which they want to buy or sell shares.
Market Orders: Orders are executed immediately at the current market price.
Dynamic User Configurations:

Number of Orders (trades): The user defines the total number of orders to be generated and processed.
Min/Max Shares (shares_limit): Users can set limits on the quantity of shares that can be bought or sold in a single order.
Market Sentiment (sentiment): Controls the bias toward buy (bullish) or sell (bearish) orders. A value closer to 1 indicates strong bullish sentiment, while values near 0 indicate bearish sentiment.
Price Spread (spread): Determines the price difference between the highest bid (buy) and the lowest ask (sell). This affects market liquidity and pricing volatility.
Initial Stock Price (current_price): Sets the starting price for the stock being traded.
